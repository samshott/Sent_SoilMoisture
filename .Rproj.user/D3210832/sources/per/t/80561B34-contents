```

First lets load in some packages to help us work with spatial data. (Note: if you are continuing working from Part 1 directly, you only need to load in the `h3` package).

```{r Setup packages}
library(h3) #aggrigation on Ubers H3 hexagon grid
library(terra) #Spatial data tools
library(leaflet) #Interactive map viewer
library(sf) #for conversion between spatial formats
library(raster)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

# Loading in the Data

Note: If you are coming directly from the post "Sentinel-2 Soil Moisture Data Mining Part 1" you will be able to use the `cummulative_moisture` variable to work with the aggregated raster already loaded into memory, and the next step can be skipped.

A handy method for reading files from your local drive is to use the `file.choose()` function from base r. This function opens up a file explorer GUI window and allows the user to select files directly from the local drive.

It's also worth mentioning, that in the case you wanted to grab several files all in the same folder you can use the function `dir.choose()`, which allows the user to select a folder, in conjunction with `list.files()` to generate a list of paths to all files in a directory. This means that if you repeated Part 1 for several different date ranges, and then outputted all cumulative rasters to one folder, you could easily read them into a vector and use `lapply()` to apply most of the functions in this tutorial to all of the rasters.

Here we will demonstrate the use of the `file.choose()` function, and although the resultant GUI won't be displayed on this page, when you run it on your local machine you should find the function quite intuitive.

```{r psuedo raster path, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
rast_path_list <- c(choose.files())

cumm_moisture_func <- function(path_list){
  #' read in all rasters in a list
  #' convert them to SpatRaster objects
  #' Append them to a list
  #' Return SpatRaster list
  
  raster_vect <- c()
  for (path in path_list){
    
    i_rast <- rast(path)
    
    raster_vect <- append(raster_vect, (i_rast))
  }
  
  return(raster_vect)
}

cummulative_moisture <- raster(sum(cumm_moisture_func(c(rast_path_list)), na.rm = TRUE))

writeRaster(cummulative_moisture, "cummulative_moisture_example", writeFormats()[24])
```

```{r read in previous raster}
rast_path <- file.choose() #find and select raster, create char vector of path to raster

webmercProj <- "+proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +wktext  +no_defs" # crs from previous exercise
# 
cummulative_moisture <- terra::rast(rast_path) #read in raster from path from previous exercise

```

# Raster to Vector Aggrigation

## Create Empty H3 polygons for the AOI

First we need to create some empty polygons (hexagons) to summarize the raster values within. Because we
